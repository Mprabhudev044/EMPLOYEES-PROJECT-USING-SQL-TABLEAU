# EMPLOYEES-PROJECT-USING-SQL-TABLEAU 

In this project i have analyzed the employee database in MYSQL to find the insights.Then i imported the results to TABLEAU to identify the trends and patterns.I have also created an interactive dashboard for the data.

The problem statements which were analyzed are as follows:

1. A breakdown between the male and female employees working in the company each year, starting from 1990

2. Compare the number of male managers to the number of female managers from different departments for each year, starting from 1990.

3. Average salary of female versus male employees in the entire company till 2002 per each department.

4. Created an SQL stored procedure to obtain the average male and female salary per department within 50000 and 90000.
